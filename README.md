Documentation for the karo-stack project

This project uses [Zensical](https://zensical.org/docs/get-started/) as it's static site generator.

Zensical is written in Python, which we manage with the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager.

```sh
# Preview as you write
uv run zensical serve

# Build the site
uv run zensical build
```
