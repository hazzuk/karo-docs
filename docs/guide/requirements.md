??? info "ARM CPU support"

    While there is no reason an ARM64/AArch64 processor won't work, it's not an architecture that is tested with. So your mileage may vary. If you encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hazzuk/karo-stack/issues/new/choose).

??? warning "Ryzen 3000 CPU's (or older)"

    If you are using an AMD Zen 1 or Zen 2 processor, you might encounter [issues with the processor's power management](https://gist.github.com/dlqqq/876d74d030f80dc899fc58a244b72df0). After installing Debian, you can fix this by adding a kernel parameter via the GRUB boot loader:

    ```sh
    sudo micro /etc/default/grub
    ```

    ```ini { title="/etc/default/grub" }
    # include for amd cpu power management mitigations
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet processor.max_cstate=1"
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="processor.max_cstate=1"
    ```

    ```sh
    sudo update-grub
    sudo reboot
    ```
